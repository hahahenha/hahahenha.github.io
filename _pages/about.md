# Biography
<hr style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
I'm currently an associate professor at Zhejiang University of Technology.
Before that, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at [AML Lab](https://aml-cityu.github.io/) from City University of Hong Kong supervised by Prof. [Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/).
I obtained the PhD degree in data science from City University of Hong Kong (CityU) supervised by Prof. [Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) and Prof. [Ding-Xuan Zhou](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/dingxuan-zhou.html). 
I obtained the BSc and MSc degrees in computer science at Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT) supervised by Prof. [Guojiang Shen](https://homepage.zjut.edu.cn//sgj/) and Prof. [Xiangjie Kong](http://www.cssclab.cn/xjkong/).

My research interests include Large Language Models, Learning Theory, City Computing, and Recommender Systems.
