Biography
======
I'm a final-year PhD candidate at [AML Lab](https://aml-cityu.github.io/) from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk) supervised by Prof. [Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/).

Before that, I obtained the BSc and MSc degrees supervised by Prof. [Guojiang Shen](https://homepage.zjut.edu.cn//sgj/) and Prof. [Xiangjie Kong](http://www.cssclab.cn/xjkong/) in computer science from Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT).

My research interests include Large Language Models, Learning Theory, City Computing, and Recommender Systems.
